export const ABOUT_TEXT =
  `Hi there! I'm Alex Guerrero, a passionate Senior Software Developer with over 6 years of experience crafting innovative digital solutions. Based in the United States, I love turning complex problems into elegant, scalable applications that make a real impact.

  My journey in software development has led me to specialize in building robust backend systems using Python (Django, FastAPI) and Node.js, while also enjoying the creative side of frontend development with React and Next.js. I'm particularly excited about creating scalable APIs (REST & GraphQL) and working with modern databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

  What drives me is the challenge of architecting solutions that not only work flawlessly but also scale beautifully. I believe in writing code that's clean, maintainable, and a joy for other developers to work with. Whether it's integrating AI/ML capabilities, optimizing database performance, or ensuring top-notch security, I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible.

  When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest in cloud technologies and AI advancements. I'm passionate about staying at the forefront of technology because that's where the most exciting challenges and opportunities lie. Let's build something amazing together!`;
