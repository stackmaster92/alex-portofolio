export const ABOUT_TEXT =
  `Hi, I'm Alex Guerrero and I'm a Senior Software Developer from United States with over 6 years of experience building scalable and reliable web and mobile applications. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, Kotlin, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

As a full-stack developer, I specialize in crafting responsive user interfaces, designing efficient APIs (REST & GraphQL), and managing robust databases. I'm committed to writing clean, maintainable code and delivering high-performance solutions that prioritize user experience.

While others may balance coding with dance or music, I channel my passion entirely into engineering smart, scalable systems that solve real-world problems.`;
